                    So The unlucky Boy fought everyone and everything just to Join in Engineering college. To the boy who lived through hell
                    found his invitation to Hogwarts and just travelled 500 km through his 9Â½ and finally there he was, at his hogwarts.
                    He wasn't expecting a multi billion Hogwarts. He was just hoping for a place where he could just <i class="italy">Wingardium Leviosar</i> 
                    himself. When he was hoping to only Wingardium Leviosar himself, he saw a kyooto kyooto butterfly flying around with pastels 
                    and rainbows. Then he became her goodie goodie friend. With each action she came closer and closer to his beating part. Before
                    realising all by himself, he was already <i class="italy">Crushing her</i>.ðŸ˜¶. With no time that crush bloomed into love.                      
                </p>
                <p class="horr padd">
                    With each day she added Sakuras and Sunsets to his life. With every clash she cursed him with <b class="lum">Lumos</b>.
                    With every parting face she cursed him with Crucio. But the boy gave her the most bitter experience through his test. It was a 
                    straight sceptum scepta for her. Yet she forgave him and started everything from the start Like an <b class="lum">Angel</b>.
                    Then started their journey. Soon the journey of two became a journey of one. Even if everyone were against them, they stood together
                    no matter what. he saw god in her.
