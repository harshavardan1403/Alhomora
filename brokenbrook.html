                        All this started on 14th February 2002, when an unlucky boy came to this planet. He was so unlucky that people in his house
                        changed his name, his birth date and they didn't even care to inform him about that untill his drunk father once blabbered it.
                        He was living his life in a environment where he saw domestic violence, the impact of alcohol in families, the injustice done
                        to women, how a good father cannot be a good husband and how to act like nothing happened. He went to a school and tried to excel
                        at anything and everything. He started to shine like a star in classes. Untill he completed his schooling, he got <b class="boldimp">five proposals</b>. And he 
                        rejected them all.

                    Then he fell in love with a girl in his tenth standard. That girl saying no broke him. His aaya dying
                    devastated him. When he was going through all this tough and rough road, there came another broke situation where he happened
                    to choose medicine instead of persuing what he wants. With all this going on, he went against the flow to join an Engineering college
                    which broke him even more after knowing his father hates him studying engineering. In all this mess, a girl caught his attention with her poems.
                    At first he didn't know she's the <b class="boldimp">END</b>. The key to all his never ending suffering. They became friends.
                    Then, they became The Best Friends. Subsequently, the boy <i class="italyimp">Developed a crush</i> on this angel. Then there happened the 
                    <b class="boldimp"> confession</b>. From then, everything started to change for the boy. <i class="italyimp undies">The unlucky boy became lucky</i>.
                    He was finally at home. A home to cuddle, snuggle and cry to. A home worth fighting for. So all I can say to her is that <b class="ily boldimp">I love you BBD</b>
