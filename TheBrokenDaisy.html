                    <p>Okay. So. The Sai before us was still affected by the Sai before Aurcm. The Sai before aurcm was totally not okays.
                        She was depressed. She was confused. She was lost. She was clueless. She was toooooooo inferior. She had her complexes. 
                        She had no hope. But. A ton lot of dreams. And. She was not so happy with where she went. Aurcm. She was homesick. 
                        She cried. And cried and cried. But as soon as the induction program started, she knew who she was.
                        She has always liked to stand in front. To be the centre of a crowd. To have the limelight. 
                        For someone who felt inferior throughout her life, she felt all of her complexes vanishing for two whole weeks. 
                        She could close her eyes and say that that would be one of the best times of her life. Without a second thought.

                    <p>After those two merry weeks. She went back to her cocoon. To her sweet little cage of complexes. 
                        What she forgot was. She made a friend when she were still a butterfly. And he. Was. The. Best. She has ever got. 
                        At first. This little butterfly felt a lot of little butterflies in her tummy on looking at him. 
                        Then. Those butterflies gave a fuzzy feeling as if. That human was her comfy place. Soon. 
                        They were not just friends. They knew it was something else. They shared everything with each other. 
                        They'd be with the other at their hard times no matter what. And. Most importantly. They found solace in each other. 
                        They both had a sad past. They both had their own kind of traumas. And what they found in each other just. 
                        Helped them to regain that list hope.
