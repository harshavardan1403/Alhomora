            <p class="para h">Their friendship soon blossomed. A beautiful Daisy was it. With all their sun coated care and and. And. 
                A crystal clear crush. They were crushing over each other too soon and. A they had their own people to catalyze the reaction. 
                This shy shy coy coy people. Uff. They were the god and goddess of being cringe. Thank God. He confessed after a truth or dare game. 
                And. That was it. A cute little beginning. She found her home. She's still clueless about her life. 
                She yet has a lot to figure out about herself. She still has got a lot of choices to make. 
                She's still confused over a lot of stuff. But. One sure thing that she's aware about is. She has found her home. 
                Her sweet little cozy jigglie wigglie home. (Hehe). It's not as if all her problems just evaporated into thin air. 
                It's. She knows she has got a hooman who'd be with her through anything and everything. Her forever. And. 
                That does make her feel like a Daisy in a field of roses. All the sunshine is hers. All the warmth is for her. 
                And. What she wishes to give is. Everything he is to her. That little boi deserves the world. 
                She should even cultivate daisies on Mars for him. That's how much happiness he deserves. 
                She's not sure if she's the best. But. She'll make herself the best for he just deserves the bests.

                And now. These two kyooto lovies are not two. They shared their first muah. First huggie bear. First earies. 
                First movie. And. They're no more kiddos. They've had their night either. (ðŸ¤­). Sooooooo. This one kyoot little bird is. 
                The most prettiest. As soft as a plushie. With hues of pastels. It has got a loooooooooong way through the clouds and moons and stars and all such celestials. 
                So. That's how the post confession Sai is. She feels at home. And. 
                She's waiting to build her igloo with her kyooto penguin. She's thankful. Like. 
                Thankful to the universe for the first time in a while. She feels loved. She feels her life being alive. She feels like a Daisy. 
                And. Thank you. For being her sunshine. And. Moonlight as well. (you taught her to fish. it's obvious that she'd love such moo(a)n and nights ðŸ¤­).
